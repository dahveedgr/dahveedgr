Faz, take 2
PLEASE NOTE: This a a legacy article, brought into Medium for archival purposes. Original post: August 6th, 2008
Faz, the soon-to-be premier magazine on User Experience in Spanish has released its second issue. This exciting publication focuses on Emotion Design… An interesting redefinition of what the practice is all about. With contributions ranging from scientists to illustrators, the topic promises to spark some debate and open as many questions as it tries to answer.
I am quite excited to see the birth of the second issue of the Spanish magazine Faz, focusing this time on the design of Emotion, Meaning and Experience.

Magazine's director Marcelo Garrido, and the full team of Revista Faz have done a great job filling what I believe has been a void in the User Experience industry in the Spanish-speaking world, by single-handedly exposing the learnings and experience in our practice from cultures other than Anglo (With writers from Spain, Chile, Holland, as well as US). Fostering the dialog and exchange between international field leaders in interaction's design, architecture, usability and research while bridging the gap between science and opinion, academia and practice… all achieved through the personal drive of many participants' personal efforts and no commercial support!
I am proud to have participated as a writing contributor on first issue, and now internally as its Creative Director and future evangelist.
We have chosen to feature artists alongside scientists to acknowledge the importance of both their impact in our work. In this issue we feature the fresh and irreverent work of Antonio Fernández-Coca as well as articles from Nathan Shedroff (San Francisco, USA), Claudio Lavín and René San Martín (Santiago, Chile); Pere Rosales (Barcelona, Spain); Salvador Mondragón and Margarita Vergara (Madrid, Spain); Eva de Lera and Muriel Garreta (Barcelona, Spain); Joaquín Márquez (Madrid, Spain) and Marco Van Hout (Maastricht, Holland).
I want to see it through to being published in two languages in upcoming issues, supported by a fully-functional website coupled to an online-driven community and facilitator of tools, content, public forums and access to the people shaping the industry. In a word: Turn it into a vehicle of public discourse for those that dabble between the science of usability & research, the realities of business & practice, and the communicative and emotional value of art & design.
This is the beginning of something beautiful.
